This folder contains a series of experiments that aims to gain some intuition about the effect
of different disk radius in the evolution of the graph-flow algorithm. In particular, we are 
interested to know if we can relate the time step of the curve-shortening flow with the choice
of the disk radius.

find-balance-radius
In this experiment, we evolve the curve-shortening flow for a continuous disk of radius R_0, that is, the 
disk radius decrease by 1/R_t at each step t. 

In parallel, we evolve the graph-flow for a discrete disk of radius R_0. The goal is to find the 
value of the balance radius such that one step of the graph-flow produces the equivalent evolution
of a one time step in the continuous curve-shortening flow. Our criteria is to maximize the ratio
(change-of-perimeter)/(current-integral-squared-curvature). 

length-ratio-decrease
It is an auxiliar method that given a binary image, the disk estimation radius and the grid
resolution, outputs the perimeter and the integral squared curvature.

limit-radius
For a given estimation radius, it computes the smallest disk in which the graph-flow is 
unable to evolve the shape. Intuitively, a estimation radius R_a smaller than R_b is less
sensitive than R_b. Therefore, it may be unable to detect small curvature values. Every
estimation radius has a limit radius in which the graph-flow does not evolve.
