We wonder if there exists a simple cost function that can induce the Willmore flow by the 
computation of minimulm cuts.

The idea here is to set the cost of a linel based on the elastica estimation on the current
shape contour. The cost is then computed by considering the distance from the closest linel in 
the shape contour.
