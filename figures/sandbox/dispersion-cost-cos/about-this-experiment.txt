This experiment is a modification with respect to dispersion-cost.

The dispersion-cost function generates results as poor as the original intrinsic elastica
cost function. An hypothesis is that the influence kernel used is not appropriate. Instead
of using an uniform kernel based on distance only, we propose to ponderate the kernel 
elements by the cos of the angle that makes the element and the normal at the shape contour,
the kernel center.

Take any linel in the shape contour. Consider a frame in which the normal at the linel is the
horizontal axis. Therefore, the influence of this linel is greater for elements that are closer
to the horizontal axis. In particular, it has zero influence for elements in the vertical axis
of this frame.
