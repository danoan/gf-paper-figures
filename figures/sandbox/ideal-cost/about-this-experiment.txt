The goal of this experiment is to define an ideal cost function for the disk shape.

Starting with a disk of radius R, we set the weight of the linels in the current contour
as the estimated value for the elastica for the linel. Next, we remove the eight contour
of the shape and we repeat the process.

However, there are linels in the domain that will not be set. Consider any sequence of n 
horizontal pixels. The common linels between these pixels have no value setted in the cost 
function. Indeed, those linels do not belong to any valid contour considered.

It does not seem to exist a way to set the cost of those linels in a non artificial way.
Here lies a crucial difference between the idea of an intrinsic elastica cost function for 
the linels and the balance coefficient approach. 

The balance coefficient approach is succesful because it can abstract a lot of information 
due to its reliance in the current contour. In the intrinsinc cost function context, the cost 
of a linel depends on the value it takes its own neighborhood. We do not want to handle 
large neighborhood.
