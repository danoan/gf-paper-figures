Initially, we proposed the intrinsic elastica cost function. This cost function was constructed
from the estimation of the elastica on the current shape contour. The cost of a linel was 
defined according to the closest linel in the shape contour, and the distance from it.

The obtained results are very poor, indicating that this cost function is not appropriate for 
the evolution of a flow based on the elastica energy. A hypothesis for its failure is the 
following: 

It is too naive, and too limiting to set the cost of a farther linel in the domain based in a 
single linel of the contour. We should expect that, if such a cost function exists, that it 
should be based on a collection of neighbor linels.

That is the motivation of the dispersion cost function. In this function, each linel in the 
shape contour contributes to some value for the cost of linels inside some kernel (for example,
a disk of radius R). Therefore, some linels may be influenced by more contour linels than 
others. To balance this effect, we set the cost of each linel as the average of all the 
influence contributions.
